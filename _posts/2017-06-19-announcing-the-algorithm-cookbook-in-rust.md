I built a reference cookbook of algorithms and data structures for contest problem solvers. It's written in Rust, as I believe it's the programming language that's best suited to the task. For more info, please check out the repository at [github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms](https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms).

With this, I hope to bring two of my favorite technology communities closer together: those surrounding [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). If you're a Rust programmer interested in honing your technical interview skills or solving cool programming puzzles, you might enjoy Codeforces. If you're a Codeforces member tired of debugging around the idiosyncracies of C++, Rust may give you a competitive edge. In either case, I hope this cookbook will ease the learning curve for you by providing clean implementations of some common algorithms. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

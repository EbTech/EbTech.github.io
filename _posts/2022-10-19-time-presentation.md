Apologies for taking so long to follow up on the [probability post](../../../2020/11/22/probability). I was floored by the engagement on Hacker News, with over 200 comments! I've revised the post to incorporate all your feedback.

Now to unveil the secret behind that post: it was a part of my preparation for a very ambitious research project concerning the [arrow of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time). This has occupied all of my writing energy, hence the absence from blogging. I've since completed that paper and presented it to [Prof. Marcus Hutter's group](http://grla.wikidot.com/frl).

You may download the [presentation slides](../../../../assets/docs/TimePresentation.pdf) or the [full paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09709), and reach out to me with any questions or comments. I look forward to collaborating on closely related topics! Naturally, this means I'm not done talking about probability and induction. Please stay tuned :)
